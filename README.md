Quick local preview

Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or `open index.html` on macOS).

Deployment suggestions (cheap/easy):
- GitHub Pages: free for static sites. Push repo to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages in repo settings.
- Netlify: free tier, drag-and-drop or connect GitHub for automatic deploys. Good for custom domain and easy HTTPS.
- Vercel: free tier for static sites, simple Git integration.

Cheap domain suggestions:
- Namecheap: affordable domains $8–15/year typically.
- Porkbun: competitively priced domains.

How to edit/design:
- Edit files directly in VS Code.
- For design tools: Figma (free tier) for mockups, or Webflow if you prefer visual site-builder (costlier).

To publish on GitHub Pages (quick):
1. Create a GitHub repo and push these files.
2. In repo Settings → Pages, select the `main` branch and root `/` folder.
3. Your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>`.

To publish on Netlify (quick):
1. Sign up at netlify.com and connect your GitHub repo OR drag-and-drop site folder into Netlify Sites.
2. Add a custom domain in Netlify settings if you bought one.

Next steps I can do for you:
- Add more project detail pages.
- Convert this to a single-page app or add CMS for easy editing.
- Wire contact form submission (requires backend or third-party service).
